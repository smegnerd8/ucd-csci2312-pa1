*  description of the  program
*******************************************************
This program will be class based and generate a series of tests using mathematical formulas for a 3d traingle to calculate area. 

*******************************************************
* Source files
******************************************************
Name:  main.cpp
   Main program. This is the driver program that calls the tests for PA1

Name:  Point.cpp
   contains the functions definititions  for the class of Point  

Name: area.cpp
    contains the formula for calculating the area of the new 3d triangle. This .cpp file uses the Point.h file to poulate the distance function inside of the class Point. These new variables then use Heron's formula to calculate the area with shortcuts
Name: Point.h
  contains point class and function definition. The new point class is 3d and has three variables. Each private variable is accompanied by a get and set memeber function .
